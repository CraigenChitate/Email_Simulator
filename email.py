An Email Simulation:
Create a class definition for an Email which has four variables:
  has_been_read, email_contents, is_spam and email_address.
The constructor should initialise the sender's email address.
The constructor should also initialise has_been_read and is_spam to false.
Create a function in this class called mark_as_read which should change
  has_been_read to true.
Create a function in this class called mark_as_spam which should change
  is_spam to true.
Create a list called inbox to store all emails (note that you can have a 
  list of objects).
Then create the following methods:
  > add_email - which takes in the contents and email address from the
      received email to make a new Email object.
  > get_count - returns the number of messages in the store.
  > get_email - returns the contents of an email in the list. For this, allow
      the user to input an index i.e. get_email(i) returns the email stored
      at position i in the list. Once this has been done, has_been_read
      should now be true.
  > get_unread_emails - should return a list of all the emails that haven't
      been read.
  > get_spam_emails - should return a list of all the emails that have been
       marked as spam.
  > delete - deletes an email in the inbox.
Now that you have these set up, let's get everything working!
Fill in the rest of the logic for what should happen when the user inputs
  send/read/quit. Some of it has been done for you.
