# Email Simulator

A Python program that simulates email messaging.

## Description

This program allows a user to create and read emails, mark and view spam emails, check unread emails and of course delete emails.

The ```email_program()``` starts the program and populates the *inbox* list using the ```add_email()``` method which takes in the contents and email address from the received email to make a new Email object.

The ```Email``` class is called to create the new Email object and has four variables:

* email_address
* email_contents
* is_spam (initialised to false)
* has_been_read (initialised to false)

A class method ```mark_as_read()``` changes *has_been_read* to true.
The class method ```mark_as_spam()``` changes *is_spam* to true.

Once the inbox is prepared, the user is then presented with options to:

* 'V'iew read and unread emails
* 'M'ark spam emails
* 'D'elete emails
* 'S'end an email

If user selects "v":
The ```get_email()``` function returns the contents of a selected email in the inbox and displays it.
The selected email object is ```mark_as_read()``` and the remaining emails are appended to the *unread* list
The ```get_unread_emails()``` function returns all the emails from the listthat havenâ€™t been read.

If user selects "m":
The ```mark_spam()``` function marks a selected email from the inbox as spam and moves it to the *spam* list.
The user is then asked if they would like to view all spam email. If yes, the ```get_spam_emails()``` function 
returns a list of all the emails in the spam list.

If user selects "d":
The ```delete()``` function removes the selected email from the inbox and moves it to the *trash* list.

If user selects "s":
An ```Email()``` object, with *email_address* and *email_message*, is created. (At this point, although not included in this project, the program's functionality can be extended to create outgoing email objects.) The new email is simply added to the *sent* list.

## Functionality summary

* Create ann send an email
* Read emails
* Mark and view spam emails
* View unread emails
* Delete emails

## Programming principles

This program practices the programming concept of classes in Object Oriented Programming. Furthermore it employs
programming functions such as enumerate, .pop(), append() and a good amount of conditional logic.

## Running the program

Run the email.py file in any Python IDE, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Class preview

```python
# Class to create new Email object.
class Email():

    # Initialise class variables for emails. 
    has_been_read = False 
    is_spam = False

    # Initialise instance variables for emails.
    def __init__(self, email_address, email_contents):
        self.email_address = email_address
        self.email_contents = email_contents
        
    # Method to change 'has_been_read' emails from False to True.
    def mark_as_read(self):    
        self.has_been_read = True
        return self.has_been_read

    # Method to change 'is_spam' emails from False to True.
    def mark_as_spam(self):
        self.is_spam = True
        return self.is_spam

```
